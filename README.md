This site was built for a bird breeder with the intention to showcase her birds and provide an easy way for potential clients to contact her.
<br>

### Version: 1.0

Single page webpage with the client provided information, and images. Contact form that routes messages directly to the client's email. Links to the client's various social media pages. Links to the client's preferred vendors. Formatted for desktop, tablet, and mobile views.

### Current version: 2.0

The client can login through a private route, once logged in the client can upload images and descriptions of the birds they have available for purchase in an 'inventory' page. Users can view the inventory but will not be able to login. Created a backend in Firebase, so the client can easily upload and maintain their artifacts.

Add a page for the client's verified customers to leave Reviews and Testimonials.
