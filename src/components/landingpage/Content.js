          <p>
            K & B Aviary was started a few years after my move to Georgia.
            Formerly The Cockatiel Zone in Southern California. It's been a 35
            year passion. It never stops amazing me how each bird has an
            individual personality. <br />
            <br />
            We strive for large, healthy birds. We breed predominantly
            Cockatiels, Green cheek Conures, American Budgies and Bourke's
            Parakeets. Hopefully in the future, Nanday Conures and Senegal's as
            well.

                <b>"Bourke's" Parakeets</b> are a great introductory bird for
                new bird owners; they have a calm demeanor and they keep
                themselves entertained. They are ideal for apartment living
                because they are quiet. They are excellent partners for finches
                and cockatiels as well as other Bourke's parakeets. Keep gentle
                Bourke's parakeets away from larger, aggressive birds.

                <b>Budgies</b> are often referred to as the "most popular bird"
                because there are more budgies in the world than any other type
                of pet bird. Budgies are known to have a big personality too;
                theyâ€™re small but full of character, cramming all the charisma
                of a parrot into a package not much bigger than a canary.

          </div>
          <p>
            Studies have shown that birds have great problem-solving skills and
            cognitive skills that prove their high-level of intellect. They have
            excellent navigation skills and migrate thousands of miles twice a
            year. <br />
            <br />
            Because they are smart, training and taming birds is easy. Among
            those bird breeds that are classified intelligent and easy to train
            are cockatiels, parrots, and cockatoos.
